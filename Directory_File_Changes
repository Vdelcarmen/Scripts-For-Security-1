#Script for security Changes in directory
#Name: Victor Delcarmen
#In his directory we're trying to find directory creation in the "/var/log/ directory"

#For this script to work a copy of "/var/log" directory must be created
#The copy must be called called Original_log_Directory
#Then a directory must be created in the /var/log directory,


#The diff utility is used to compare two files/directories together in order to find differences
#The diff command is comparing "Original_log_Directory" with the "/var/log/" directory
This script will point ou the creation of the file you created in /var/log


#The output will be redirected to a file called "Changes"
diff Original_log_Directory/  /var/log > Changes


#Grepping for mkdir will show us all the creating of directories
cat Changes | grep mkdir
